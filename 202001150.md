Q.1)  

The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.

> Ans: 

Functional Requirements : 
1. For issuing and returning the books, Proper authentication should be there since valid users (members) of LIS are allowed to issue and return books.
2. This web application will run on the institute LAN, so any non-member who is just connected to LAN can use this system to browse/ search books online.
3. Only valid LIS users should be able to borrow (or return) the book.
4. The LIS user should also be able to extend the date of borrowing if no other booking is made for that particular book.
5. LIS user's issuing and returning process should be automated because large-scale manual management will cause delays.
6. Library staff should have administrative privileges and complete control of the system database.
7. Librarians can add and delete records of books when new books are purchased or taken off the shelf, respectively.
8. Database should be created to log every issue and return of books.
9. First-time users should be able to create profiles.
10. User should be given a reminder of the due date via email or message (depending on the user's information in the database).
11. If the user does not obey the due date penalty should be applied to the user, and a message should be given to the user for the same. 
12. Smart search should be given to search books by labels such as a person, genre, publication, author, subject, title, ISBN etc.
13. User should be able to keep track of his/her favourite books.

Non-functional Requirement:
1. Security/Data Encryption: All user data should be encrypted. 
2. Usability: LIS should have a user-friendly UI.
3. Scalability: As mentioned in the question, the institute is increasing with time. Because of this fact, the complete system should be scalable.
4. Availability: The application must support a continuous level of availability under average operating volumes and concurrency levels, with no application performance degradation. The application must be available between 7 am and 10 pm (usual library time), seven days a week.
5. Recoverability and Disaster Recovery: A backup of data should be there so that data can be recovered in the event of a primary data failure.
6. Utilization: Considering the impact of high volumes of transactions on your infrastructure, we have to utilize given resources efficiently. one way to achieve this is to use cloud services.

Q.2) 

Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

> Ans: 

Scope : 
1. This system can widely be used by people suffering from disabling hearing loss disease. The system should easily be able to capture the surrounding daily sounds like motor car horns and bicycle horns.
2. After capturing the sound, the medium of providing the user's information can be anything from an alert message or text on the screen to a vibration and haptic response.
3. The low-latency app can work in real-time for use and response, as mentioned above in real-time.
It can also have a feature for emergency alarms like fire alarms; in this emergent case, the system should flash light with intense colours to get attention.

Feature : 
1. Recognition of critical sound events of interest to the hearing-impaired community, such as car horns and babies.
2. Immediate alerts when key sound events are detected; alerts can be of different mediums like text, vibration, haptic responses etc.
Continual logging of sound events for the user.
3. It is optimized for Android devices with low latency for real-time use.
4. If a person is born deaf, then the system should also have the option of learning sign messages; we can also give an option for text in different languages.
AI should be well-trained so that its precision is high.

Non-functional aspects : 
1. Usability: This system should have a user-friendly UI. Specially designed keeping deaf people in mind.
2. Scalability:  The complete system should be scalable so that if the user pool increases, the app should not crash or give wrong outputs.
3. Availability: The application must support a continuous level of availability under average operating volumes and concurrency levels, with no application performance degradation. The application must be available 24/7.
4. Utilization: The app should use minimal infrastructure and power, considering it might e used by the user for many hours continuously.
