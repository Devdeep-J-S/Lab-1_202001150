Q.1)  

The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.

Functiional Requirements : 
1. For issuing and returing the books Proper authentication should be there since valid users (members) of LIS are allowed to issue and return books.
2. This web application will run on institute LAN so any non-member who is just connected to LAN will be able to use this system to browse/ search boooks online.
3. Only valid LIS user should be able to borrow (or return) the book.
4. The LIS user should also be able to extend the date of borrowing if no other booking  is made for that particular book.
5. LIS user's issuing and returning processs should be automated because with large scale manual managing will cause delay.
6. Library staff should have administrative privilages and complete control of system database.
7. Librarian can add and delete record of books when new books are purchased or books are taken of the shelf respectively.
8. Database should be created in order to log every issue and return of books.
9. First time user should be able to create profile.
10. User should be given reminder of due date via email or message (depends on information of user in database).
11. If user does not obey due date penalty should be applied on user and message should be gievn to user for the same. 
12. Smart search should be given to search books by different labels such as person,genre,punlication,author,subject,title,ISBN etc.
13. User should be able to keep track of his/her favourite books.

Non-functional Requirement:
1. Security/Data Encryption : All user data should be encrypted . 
2. Usability : LIS should have user friendly UI.
3. Scalabilty: As mentioned in question institute is increasing with time beacuse of this fact the complete system should be scalable.
4. Availabilty : The application must be able to support a continuous level of availability under levels of normal operating volumes and concurrency, with no application performance degradation.The application must be available between 7am and 10pm (usual library time), 7 days a week.
5. Recoverability and Disaster Recovery : Backup of databse should be there so that data can be recovered in the event of a primary data failure.
6. Utilisation: By considering the impact of high volumes of transactions on your infrastructure we have to utilize given resource efficiently.one way to achive this is to use clound services.

Q.2) 

Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
